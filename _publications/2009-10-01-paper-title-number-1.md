title: "Effects of Enhanced Legal Aid in Child Welfare: Evidence from a Randomized Trial of Mi Abogado"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper presents an experimental evaluation conducted in collaboration with the Experimental Policy Initiative of the Chilean Budget Office. The study explores the impact of the Mi Abogado program, which provides legal aid and social services to foster children in Chile. Our findings show that the program not only reduces the length of stay in foster care but also enhances various aspects of child well-being, including lower criminal justice involvement and improved school attendance. Importantly, the program achieves these outcomes at a cost that is more than offset by the savings generated from shorter foster care stays. The study serves as a compelling case for the potential benefits of investing in the quality of foster care services. '
